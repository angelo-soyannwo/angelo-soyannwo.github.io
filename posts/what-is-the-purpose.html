                "The life of theosis entails our becoming fully human even as Christ was fully human. 
                We are to become by grace what He is by nature, as the Lord's Prayer indicates: 
                we are meant to be gods dwelling in accord with each other on earth here and now as also in heaven."

                The logical endpoint of atheism is complete ethical nihilism. There is no objective right. There is no wrong. 
                Things only are. There is no objective good, no objective meaning to any suffering, and no objective evil. 
                Things only exist without any objective value statements. Without an external higher authority to imbue things with 
                purpose and telos, and to define the general order of things, there is only subjective meaning imbued to things by individuals.

                Life can be very difficult. All humans, independent of an individual's wealth or health, can be subjected to intense mental and physical suffering. 
                Sometimes one may even feel that there is no point in bringing more people into the world due to the intense anguish that one may be subjected to. 
                If there is a higher authority who imbues the world and things within it with purpose, there is some objective telos. 
                If the ultimate end of existence intended by said God was human happiness and enjoyment then I think our universe is a failed experiment. 
                However, I believe that the ultimate purpose of this world is the creation of virtuous souls.

                Divine transfiguration or theosis is the ultimate endpoint of life in my opinion: true alignment with God. Conforming one’s character, patterns of behavior, 
                and thought processes to be aligned with God in every moment of one’s life: divine transfiguration. Living in line with the wisdom and system of 
                values set out by God is the ultimate end of life. Attaining strength and power, to make manifest God’s order and for the sake of those that lack their own strength, 
                is the telos of human life. All else is distraction. Much in the 21st century is vain hedonism that keeps people sedated.

                Accruing power and strength aid one along the path of living a virtuous life. Power, wealth and strength can help one to prevent others from imposing their will upon you. 
                However, it is important to remember God is sovereign over all. In spite of how strong and powerful one is, God can hand victory to one’s enemies. This does not mean that 
                individuals cannot take reasonable precautions, just that one must remember, “safety is of the Lord”. The ability to create or live in your own polity and shape laws to be 
                aligned with God’s telos would be one of the main reasons for accruing wealth and power at a civilizational scale. The noble aim is to possess absolute overwhelming force,
                whilst being well tempered enough to not use it. "Be as wise as a serpent but as innocent as a dove".

            <p class="text" itemprop="articleBody">
                In this life, "Bravery cannot be victorious unless it is arrayed along with justice." Virtue is treating people and things in alignment with the hierarchy of values that God has set out. 
                Valiant individual action must also be aligned with charity, kindness, wisdom, love for one’s neighbor, and love for God. In my opinion, the purpose of this Life is to align oneself with 
                God and make manifest his created order in the world. As an individual I think one will be best when they are doing that.
